            <h2>My First Visit to Boston</h2>
            <p>I visited Boston for the first time last year, and had a blast. Not only was it a diverse area full of food, activities, and people. It was a clean, well cared for city with a ton of history present as well. There is a ton of historical spots to visit, as well as a plethora of tourism activities to participate in. We had a great time touring the area, eating all over (Little Italy was great), seeing sights, and shopping. We took a bus down to Newport to see some of the most insanely lavish homes I have ever seen in person. And we took a day to go to Fenway and see a baseball game in a historic ballpark, which was a blast. I would highly recommend going to visit if you have the opportunity.</p>

            <h2>The Breakers in Newport, RI</h2>
            <p>We visited the Breakers and saw one of the most lavish and overly styled buildings I have ever seen in person. This property was massive, and is now a historical artifact, which is how they allow the tours. We took a bus from downtown Boston a short walk from our hotel, and then drove roughly an hour to see this and some of the other houses. There is also an absolutely massive house made entirely out of imported marble built in the late 1800s I believe. Absolutely incredible.</p>

            <h2>Boston's Museums and Historic Sites</h2>
            <p>We also got to see several wonderful museums, including the Museum of Fine Arts, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, and the Boston Public Library. The art and history in Boston are not only plentiful, but expertly cared for, including historic churches, museums, houses, and more. They have kept the city rich with history, and make a strong effort to keep it clean and well preserved.</p>

            <h2>Fenway Park Experience</h2>
            <p>I am a big-time baseball fan, and while I am not personally a Boston Red Sox fan, the stadium is known to be a historic place to see baseball, and it did not disappoint. We got there early, walked around the outside of the stadium which is a market area of sorts, including the team store, restaurants, and beer gardens, and then caught most of the game either in our seats or walking around looking at different areas, like the historic Green Monster. We had a great time.</p>

            <h2>Walking the Freedom Trail</h2>
            <p>We spent a day walking the Freedom Trail, a historic route laid and marked by red brick through the city, known as the Freedom Trail. If you're a fan of the video game Fallout, this trail (and much of the city) is accurately modeled after the real city of Boston, and the Freedom Trail starts you on a long questline. It was fun to see some of the real-world locations, that are all linked to historic places, people, or events.</p>
